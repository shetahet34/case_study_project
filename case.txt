1.Low usage leads to churn: Customers with very few total sessions (1–5) are far more likely to churn.
Suggestion: Monitor usage drops and trigger re-engagement actions early.

2.Poor feedback predicts churn: Churned users mostly gave feedback scores between 2–4.
Suggestion: Proactively follow up with customers who submit low feedback.

3.Monthly plans are riskier: Monthly subscribers show higher churn compared to quarterly and yearly users.
Suggestion: Encourage engaged monthly users to switch to longer-term plans.

4.Recency matters: Long gaps since last login are common among churned customers.
Suggestion: Set inactivity alerts and send reminders or offers before disengagement deepens.
